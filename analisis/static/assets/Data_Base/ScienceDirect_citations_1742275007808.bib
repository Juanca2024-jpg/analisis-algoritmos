abstract = {This paper introduces the DPGraphJ package, a collection of reusable Java functions to solve optimisation problems using a dynamic programming algorithm. The latter is based on a recursive schema that follows a top-down approach and uses the memoisation technique. This algorithm is a reusable software component that is generic and efficient. Moreover, it has been developed by paying special attention to good practices in the design of software. For using DPGraphJ, the problem to be solved needs to be modelled as an AND/OR graph. In the DPGraphJ package, we provide 5 academic case studies with detailed comments. We strongly believe that our proposal can be helpful for several kinds of users, such as students, researchers, and practitioners.}

abstract = {Background
Surgical scheduling is pivotal in managing daily surgical sequences, impacting patient experience and hospital resources significantly. With operating rooms costing approximately US $36 per minute, efficient scheduling is vital. However, global practices in surgical scheduling vary, largely due to challenges in predicting individual surgeon times for diverse patient conditions. Inspired by the Toyota Production System’s efficiency in addressing similar logistical challenges, we applied its principles as detailed in the book “Lean Thinking” by Womack and Jones, which identifies processes that do not meet customer needs as wasteful. This insight is critical in health care, where waste can compromise patient safety and medical quality.
Objective
This study aims to use lean thinking and Toyota methods to develop a more efficient surgical scheduling system that better aligns with user needs without additional financial burdens.
Methods
We implemented the 5 principles of the Toyota system: specifying value, identifying the value stream, enabling flow, establishing pull, and pursuing perfection. Value was defined in terms of meeting the customer’s needs, which in this context involved developing a responsive and efficient scheduling system. Our approach included 2 subsystems: one handling presurgery patient data and another for intraoperative and postoperative data. We identified inefficiencies in the presurgery data subsystem and responded by creating a comprehensive value stream map of the surgical process. We developed 2 Excel (Microsoft Corporation) macros using Visual Basic for Applications. The first calculated average surgery times from intra- or postoperative historic data, while the second estimated surgery durations and generated concise, visually engaging scheduling reports from presurgery data. We assessed the effectiveness of the new system by comparing task completion times and user satisfaction between the old and new systems.
Results
The implementation of the revised scheduling system significantly reduced the overall scheduling time from 301 seconds to 261 seconds (P=.02), with significant time reductions in the revised process from 99 seconds to 62 seconds (P<.001). Despite these improvements, approximately 21% of nurses preferred the older system for its familiarity. The new system protects patient data privacy and streamlines schedule dissemination through a secure LINE group (LY Corp), ensuring seamless flow. The design of the system allows for real-time updates and has been effectively monitoring surgical durations daily for over 3 years. The “pull” principle was demonstrated when an unplanned software issue prompted immediate, user-led troubleshooting, enhancing system reliability. Continuous improvement efforts are ongoing, except for the preoperative patient confirmation step, which requires further enhancement to ensure optimal patient safety.
Conclusions
Lean principles and Toyota’s methods, combined with computer programming, can revitalize surgical scheduling processes. They offer effective solutions for surgical scheduling challenges and enable the creation of a novel surgical scheduling system without incurring additional costs.}

The technical solutions adopted to create and distribute content are described and motivated on the basis of reliability, sustainability, ease of uptake and use. Examples from courses in the domains of physics, chemistry, and materials science are shown to demonstrate the style and level of interactivity of typical applications. The tools presented are easy to use, and create a uniform and open environment exploitable by a large community of teachers, students, and researchers with the goal of facilitating learning and avoiding, when possible, duplication of efforts in creating teaching material.

However, on the one hand it might be complicated for teachers to develop such interactive content; on the other hand, students need to be able to access very quickly and efficiently the content, reducing the time needed to install libraries and dependencies that might differ between courses. Solution method: Here, we developed interactive web applications to complement teaching and encourage computational thinking for courses in computational physics, chemistry and materials science, using Jupyter notebooks and their rendering as interactive web applications. The latter is powered by a combination of Voila, to hide code and convert notebooks into live web applications, and (existing or custom) Jupyter widgets to enable interactiveness. The code is ready to be deployed via a number of open approaches.}

Eye tracker has portability, straightforward application, cost-effectiveness, and infant-friendly neuroimaging measures of cognitive processes such as attention, engagement, and learning. Furthermore, the ongoing software enhancements coupled with the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms have improved the precision of collecting eye movement data and simplified the calibration process. These characteristics make it plausible to consider eye-tracking technology a promising tool to assist the teaching-learning process in school routines. However, eye tracking needs to be explored more as an educational instrument for real-time classroom activities and teachers' feedback. This perspective article briefly presents the fundamentals of the eye-tracking technique and four illustrative examples of employing this method in everyday school life. The first application shows how eye tracker information may contribute to teacher assessment of students' computational thinking in coding classes. In the second and third illustrations, we discuss the additional information provided by the eye-tracker to the teacher assessing the student's strategies to solve fraction problems and chart interpretation. The last illustration demonstrates the potential of eye tracking to provide Real-time feedback on learning difficulties/disabilities. Thus, we highlight the potential of the eye tracker as a complementary tool to promote personalized education and discuss future perspectives. In conclusion, we suggest that an eye-tracking system could be helpful by providing real-time student gaze leading to immediate teacher interventions and metacognition strategies.}

However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding its influence on students' cognitive development from a multilevel perspective. This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three-level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students’ cognitive learning (i.e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education. Recommendations for future research are discussed.}

How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. Instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving miniOS kernel—a witness to the collective effort of each class. Since its inception in 2015, the miniOS pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the OS community engagement on campus. Through this initiative, we have gleaned six key insights and six lessons, which we are eager to share with the broader educational community.}

Integrating the developed tools into a unified framework is considered and the essential role of the human in the process is discussed. The task framework is developed by considering the approach of computational thinking whose components are abstraction, algorithms, mathematical models and ability to scale. Beginning with the human FDE procedure expressed in algorithmic form, mathematical and software implementations of individual steps of the algorithm are described. Advantages of the framework are discussed, including efficiency (ability to scale to tasks with many handwritten items), reproducibility and validation/improvement of existing manual procedures. It is indicated that as with other expert systems, such as for medical diagnosis, current automation tools are useful only as part of a larger manually intensive procedure. This viewpoint is illustrated with a well-known FDE case, concerning the Lindbergh kidnapping with a new hypothesis – in this case, there are multiple questioned documents, possibility of multiple writers of the same document, determining whether the writing is disguised, known writing is formal while questioned writing is informal, etc. Observations are made for future developments, where human examiners provide handwriting characteristics while computational methods provide the necessary statistical analysis.}

Despite its importance, little is known about when and how mental rotation processes are activated in games explicitly targeting spatial reasoning tasks. In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. In this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the TetrisTM game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an ACT-R based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness.}

I briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of culture—embodied versus embedded—and argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) “handles” in the environment. When schemas are “objectively adapted” to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational. To explain ecologically rational culture-in-action, I outline a formal approach to cultural learning based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learning theory. I illustrate my approach throughout with examples drawn from the sociology of science.}

Utilizing large-scale, representative data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018 (15,015 teachers in 1195 schools in eight countries), we performed multilevel structural equation modeling and regression trees and found that teacher motivation and collaboration were positively and consistently linked to teaching practices across countries. Besides, principals' expectations concerning the teaching with technology explained variation in Finnish and German schools. In three countries, teachers' professional development was related to their teaching practices. Finally, countries’ economic development and innovation explained variation in the teacher-level effects. Our study sheds new light on the possible factors related to teaching with technology and advances the field by taking a multilevel and international perspective on these factors.}

abstract = {K-12 AI education not only equips students with AI literacy but also encourages underrepresented groups to pursue further studies or careers in this field. Secondary students were particularly well-suited for comprehensive AI education due to their cognitive characteristics and developmental readiness. While most studies have focused on developing pedagogy, curriculum, and tools for secondary AI education, they have prioritized measuring students' learning outcomes over literacy development. Referring to the empirical research on secondary AI education as well as Piaget's Epistemology and Bloom's Taxonomy, this study figured out a KAT framework that constitutes AI literacy: (1) AI Knowledge (AI fundamentals, elements of AI technology, application of AI technology), (2) AI Affectivity (AI and human, AI and society), and (3) AI Thinking (engineering design thinking, computational thinking). Based on this, a 57-item AI literacy scale (AILS) was developed, and 56 items were retained after expert judgement. Then, a large sample of Chinese secondary students was surveyed, resulting in 1392 valid samples, which were randomly divided into two sub-samples: 720 samples were used for item reduction through Rasch Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis; 672 samples were used for model validation and comparison through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results indicated the AILS with three-factor structure of 48 items has a good reliability and validity. Moreover, gender differences in AI literacy among secondary students were examined. Results indicated that boys had significantly higher AI Knowledge than girls, whereas girls had significantly higher AI Affectivity than boys. The implications, limitations and future research were also discussed.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has changed lifestyles, work patterns, and educational approaches. However, courses that can guide students through the practical applications of AI technology are still scarce in K-12 education. This study aimed to develop a project-based machine learning (ML) course for the implementation of AI technology. The core idea of this course, which focused on the supervised learning of AI ML technology, was designed based on the project of weather prediction. Furthermore, data collection and status display were realized using various hardware devices such as Arduino and sensors, whereas ML algorithms were implemented in Python programming language. A total of 68 eleventh-grade senior high school students from a public school in Southern Taiwan participated in this study. The main variables included understanding AI concepts, computational thinking (CT), and learning attitude. Data were analyzed using quantitative statistics, including descriptive statistics, t-test, and analysis of covariance, supplemented with qualitative data. Based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the proposed course on the implementation of ML helps students understand the basic concepts of AI; (2) students demonstrate a significant improvement in CT skills after attending this course; (3) although the students’ attitude toward learning AI shows no significant change after attending this course, their overall view for it is positive; (4) contrary to their learning attitude, the CT skills among the students with different capabilities of learning AI are significantly dissimilar. Overall, the machine-learning implementation course developed in this study can serve as a reference for promoting AI education in the future. However, considering learners’ prior knowledge in programming, setting up appropriate learning scaffolding for them, and providing them with more examples of the applications of AI in real-life scenarios is still necessary when conducting the course for improving the students’ attitude toward AI.}

In addition, computational thinking is a critical skill for solving problems in complex systems. We conclude our study with three suggestions that help make mathematics more explicit in K–12 STEM classrooms.}

abstract = {We present a theory of the causes of difficulty in children’s creation of informal programs. Ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mAbducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mAbducer’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. Children’s errors are predictable in both their location and nature. Our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking.}

Referring to the programming knowledge, a rubric was created to analyze the data from screen recordings, observation and interviews were used together to reveal the students’ abstraction performances. The results suggested that students performed high in elimination, focusing and generalization; however, students’ performances were relatively low in customization. Students’ explanations were mostly related the nature of the problems, affordances of BBPE and the programming constructs used in coding.

We conducted this scoping review to evaluate, synthesize and display the latest literature on AI in ECE. This review analyzed 17 eligible studies conducted in different countries from 1995 to 2021. Although few studies on this critical issue have been found, the existing references provide up-to-date insights into different aspects (knowledge, tools, activities, and impacts) of AI for children. Most studies have shown that AI has significantly improved children's concepts regarding AI, machine learning, computer science, and robotics and other skills such as creativity, emotion control, collaborative inquiry, literacy skills, and computational thinking. Future directions are also discussed for researching AI in ECE.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy education mainly targets secondary and university students, often overlooking the unique needs of younger students. This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students. The research contributes by conceptualizing AI literacy and guiding policymakers and curriculum designers to implement holistic AI literacy education for young students.}

A total of 714 K-12 students in China's Zhejiang Province participated in this study and completed an online questionnaire, which included the learning engagement scale and the high-order thinking tendency scale. Cross-sectional survey data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression as a way to examine the relationship between the variables. The results showed that cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, and behavioral engagement were all key factors in developing those students' higher-order thinking for programming learning activities in K-12 students during associated activities. Furthermore, when the students' emotional engagements were elevated, the positive relationships between cognitive engagement, computational thinking, and creative thinking were closer. Inversely, when students' behavioral engagement was high, the positive relationship between cognitive engagement and critical thinking, and the positive relationship between emotional engagement and problem-solving and critical thinking became looser. These results can help deepen educators' understanding of the relationship between learning engagement and higher-order thinking skills to facilitate their search for effective strategies to improve programming instruction. Additionally, it can provide a more precise research direction for the broader development of programming education.}

There is a critical need to understand how to attract Black girls and other girls of color to the science, technology, engineering, math, and computer science (STEM+CS) field. This study aims to look at the design and implementation of a CS learning ecosystem that supports girls of color in acquiring critical CS skills starting in middle school.
Design/methodology/approach
This mixed-method case study included 53 girls, between the ages of 11 and 13, in four US middle schools. Study methods included the analysis of a pre-program student survey, longitudinal interviews and focus groups, weekly observations and computing artifacts.
Findings
Program participants were interested in CS, were confident in their ability to learn CS, had prior coding and CS experience and had parents and teachers who encouraged them to learn CS. But some students showed dependent learning behaviors while engaging in CS activities. These included relying on instructors and being reticent to make mistakes–behaviors that limit learning. The CS learning ecosystem supported students as they shifted from applying dependent learning approaches to applying independent learning approaches. Instructors sustained a growth mindset and supported productive struggle as students learned CS skills.
Originality/value
A CS learning system supported equitable learning experiences and helped students develop independent learning behaviors that led to deeper engagement in CS.}

These learning systems are meant to reliably understand the essence of a situation and construct critical decision recommendations to support autonomous and human–machine teaming operations. In parallel, the increasing volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, and variability of data is confounding the complexity of these new systems – creating challenges in terms of their development and implementation. For artificial systems supporting critical decisions with higher consequences, safety has become an important concern. Methods are needed to avoid failure modes and ensure that only desired behavior is permitted.

Since the developmental characteristics of students in the lower grades of elementary school are different, it is difficult to apply them as they are. Therefore, it is necessary to study the following AI education teaching and learning methods suitable for lower grade students. In this study, we develop a teaching system design model for artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education for elementary school students in the lower grades, and based on this, design and apply an artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education program.

In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1–9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4–6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers’ knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students’ skill and ambition level.}

The review presents empirical investigations with young learners and reports on relevant frameworks and curriculum programs, effects of teaching approaches and educational tools on learning, and learning outcomes and pedagogical benefits of teaching programming. Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy.

abstract = {This study aimed at developing an instructional tool for the artificial intelligence education of young students, and used learning analytics to identify the sequential learning behavioral patterns of students during the process of learning with the instructional tool. The instructional experiment took 9 weeks. The first stage of the course was 5 weeks spent on individual learning of MIT App Inventor and Personal Image Classifier. The second stage was 4 weeks spent on cooperative learning to make a robot car and play a computational thinking board game. In the second stage, the students worked in pairs to make the robot car. Finally, they played the computational thinking board game with the personal image classification application they developed in the first stage and the robot car they made in the second stage. The innovative studies found meaningful behavioral patterns when the young students learned the application of artificial intelligence with the instructional tool developed and proposed in the study.}

Drawing on the sociocultural theory of learning and participation, this case study explored how six very young children taught and explored Google’s Teachable Machine in nonschool settings. Through fine-grained analysis of video recordings and interviews with the children, the article illustrates the content and the process of teaching where 3–9 year old children were producing machine learning data sets and models as well as observing, exploring, and explaining their own interaction with machine learning systems. The results illustrate the quick-paced and embodied nature of the child-computer interaction that also supported children to reason about the relationship between their own bodily expressions and the output of an interactive ML-based tool. The article concludes with discussions on the emergent process of teaching and learning as well as on ways of promoting children’s participation and sense of agency in the age of machine learning.}

The data were analyzed using a One-way MANOVA and through correlational methods. Results show that the students’ attitudes towards robotics and STEM were positive. Gender had no effect on STEM attitudes. However, in terms of robotics attitudes, female students had significantly less desire and less confidence to learn robotics than male students. There was no gender effect on computational thinking and teamwork.

abstract = {Computational thinking and coding for children are attracting increasing attention. There are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. One major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. In this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure children’s learning and activity indicators. The goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand children’s activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between children’s attitudes and their gaze. In this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. We recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. The results showed a significant relation between children’s attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). Eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted to shed additional light on children’s experience and learning duringcoding.}

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings.}

In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities.}

This paper continues the tradition of the uniform approach and proposes a small number of general mechanisms that cope with the main known effects of computing as a science — the interaction of objects-as-processes, the interaction of processes with the environment, generalized interaction. As shown, the applicative prestructure (objects-as-processes, application) generates an applicative structure (processes, application, values), which ensures the generation of the result — the value of interactions, enabling the process of evaluation. The theory of combinators is used as the main (meta)mathematical means. A diagram mechanism has been developed that implements the emerging applicative computational system of object interaction and reflects the arity of accompanying the induced information processes. The processes are bidirectional in nature, both with a decrease in arity – reduction, and with an increase in arity – expansion.}

Yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on children's cognitive development. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5 classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8 h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop), were used to assess children's skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. Such findings add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding, deepening our understanding of the positive implications of introducing Computational Thinking early in the school curriculum.}

Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. The open and maker philosophies behind Phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. The textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students. In this work we discuss LOGO and other projects inspired by it, and we also share the methodology and design decisions behind Phogo, the results of its application in a workshop and the improvements we are currently developing.}

After decades of national neglect, there has been a sudden impetus to reintroduce CS into the 11-16 age school curriculums. Immediate obstacles include a generation of children with no CS background and an estimated need for 20,000 new CS teachers - existing UK IT teachers being insufficiently qualified and experienced. The Computing at School (CAS) movement has been instrumental in this quantum transition from an IT to Computing syllabus, as have the British Computer Society (BCS), leading UK universities and a number of major international technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, IBM, British Telecom and Facebook.This paper discusses the background to this position and the progress being made to address these challenges. It describes, in particular, the work of the BCS-funded Glyndwr University ‘Turing Project’ in introducing Welsh high-school students and staff to high-level programming and ‘computational thinking’. The Turing Project uses an innovative combination of Lego NXT Mindstorm robots, Raspberry Pi computers and PicoBoard hardware together with the Robot C and Scratch programming platforms. The paper discusses initial objectives and the general approach, describes focused delivery across different age groups and ability ranges and presents results and analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the programme.

R software was employed for analyzing effect sizes, detecting publication bias, and conducting subgroup analyses. Using the k-means algorithm, two studies identified as outliers were excluded. After removing these outliers, the findings revealed a positive effect of GBL on students' mathematics HOTS, with an overall effect falling within the small category (g=.134, p<.001). Additionally, moderator variables, including educational level, measured thinking skills, continent, control treatment, and intervention duration, significantly influenced the improvement of HOTS using GBL, while the sample size factor showed no significant impact. All findings, limitations, and implications are discussed in this article.
Resumen
Las tendencias de investigación educativa muestran un creciente interés en comprender el impacto de los juegos en el logro en matemáticas. Sin embargo, solo un número limitado de estudios ha sintetizado investigaciones cuantitativas previas para investigar cómo el aprendizaje basado en juegos (ABJ) influye en la mejora de las habilidades de pensamiento de alto nivel (HOTS) de los estudiantes en matemáticas. Para abordar esta brecha, se ha realizado un estudio de metaanálisis con el objetivo de investigar la efectividad del ABJ en las HOTS matemáticas de los estudiantes. El estudio ha analizado 40 tamaños de efecto de 13 estudios empíricos publicados desde 2010 hasta 2024, recopilados de bases de datos electrónicas como Scopus, Eric y Pro-Quest. Se ha empleado el software R para analizar los tamaños de efecto, detectar sesgo de publicación y realizar análisis de subgrupos. Utilizando el algoritmo k-means, se han excluido dos estudios identificados como valores atípicos. Después de eliminar estos valores atípicos, los hallazgos han revelado un efecto positivo del ABJ en las HOTS matemáticas de los estudiantes, con un efecto general situado dentro de la categoría pequeña (g=.134, p<.001). Además, se ha encontrado que variables moderadoras, incluido el nivel educativo, las habilidades de pensamiento medidas, el continente, el tratamiento de control y la duración de la intervención, han influido significativamente en la mejora de las HOTS mediante el ABJ; mientras que el factor de tamaño de la muestra no ha mostrado un impacto significativo. Se han discutido todos los hallazgos, limitaciones e implicaciones en este artículo.}

abstract = {This study explores the nexus of gamification, artificial intelligence (AI), and mathematics cognition. Sample size of 71 responded in an intervention using game-based learning (GBL) approach. The purpose of designing the GBL was to enhance computational thinking and mathematical skills. The research employed multigroup partial least squares structural equation modelling (MGA-PLS-SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) through multilayer perceptron (MLP) as data analysis technique. The findings showed significant positive influence on class engagement, attitudes toward mathematics, as well as student performance. The analysis also revealed gender-related variations, which affirmed the model's consistency across diverse groups. The study validated the hypothesis and consequently advocated for the transformative potential of gamification, in preparation of 21st-century learners for AI-driven digital landscape. The implications are to ensure the integration of gamified elements into educational strategies, benefiting educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers resonating strongly for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers.}

We draw on the concept of infrastructuring to shed light on how to create and sustain the social, material, political and organizational structures that form the basis for introducing the new national initiative. Based on our case, we distill seven propositions that describe more generally how to work strategically with this challenge.}

This educational idea is motivated by (1) literature supporting the position that visual thinking and spatial reasoning significantly impact STEAM disciplines, and (2) Piaget’s theory of cognitive development in which children, in the concrete operational stage, solve problems relating to physical objects (i.e., they learn-by-making). A project is then described involving the creation of a 3D artifact we call a Wunderlich cube — a mathematical artifact that embodies numerous spatial reasoning puzzles. An understanding of the properties of the Wunderlich cube is developed through manual construction using LEGO®, mathematical analysis, computational thinking, coding, and 3D printing.}

The book is commendable for its tight integration of technical and socio-critical aspects of computing, approachable conversational style, and collection of flexible and practical resources for teachers. It would benefit from refinement of the integration chapters and a more explicit model for how educators themselves can approach new or different CS concepts through a critical frame. Overall, we strongly recommend this book for CS Educators at all levels for its balance of depth and practicality.}

Here, we use novel analytic methods to characterize these action sequences in detail, including which individual parts of the structure (‘states’) are built and how these structures are combined, creating a fully specified build path towards the final structure. We find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. The individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths. Our approach serves as a lens into the cognitive processes underlying block building and suggests that children’s building is guided by significant cognitive constraints consistent with “computational thinking”.}

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of two social factors (gender and partnership) on PP in a primary school setting. To that end, we conducted PP experiments in four classes from the sixth grade in a Chinese primary school. The research results indicated: (a) there was no significant difference on compatibility among the gender pairs, but a significant difference among partnership pairs; (b) there was no significant difference on programming achievement and confidence among different pairs, and girls became more productive and confidence in PP; and (c) PP tightened up the partnership within pairs. These findings suggest that teachers should take partnership into account as an important factor in PP or other collaborative learning, and adopt PP as an effective approach to decrease the gender gap in programming courses, and make students socialize.}

The aim of this study is to assess the use of a Visual Programming Language using Scratch in classroom practice, analyzing the outcomes and attitudes of 107 primary school students from 5th to 6th grade in five different schools in Spain. The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The “Computational concepts and computational practices” dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. The “Learning processes and coding in primary education” dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary education. Due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a Visual Programming Language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in primary education through a cross-curricular implementation.}

Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary school teachers, and a mixed-methods approach was employed to analyze them. The results show that explicit guidelines for renewed curricula and motivation to learn Informatics are both identified as the main barriers and drivers for integrating Informatics. The study further highlights the critical role of resources, appropriate tools, and guidelines in facilitating the successful implementation of Informatics.

In addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. Further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. Moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. Therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. In this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. Multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. Conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms.}

Programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using AI or other future technology. However, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. Technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients.}

We then use co-word analysis to identify future directions in the field. Overall, we find that research on 21st century skills has grown exponentially in the past two decades, however, few researchers focus primarily on this topic. The existing research is primarily dominated by psychologists, education researchers and technology researchers.

Our goal is to examine differences between boys and girls using eye-tracking as an objective measure and triangulating the findings with qualitative data coming from children's interviews. The results show no statistically significant difference between female and male gaze and learning gain during the coding activity; interestingly, the qualitative data show differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding, and in perceptions about those coding activities. Our results highlight that further studies need to utilize objective measures and unveil necessary differences in the design and implementation of coding activities. Furthermore, our results provide objective evidence that female students do not lack in competences compared to boys, but simply that they have a different approach during coding activities and different perspectives about coding, an approach that needs to be cultivated and nurtured.}

First, a two-step cluster analysis was administered to find how three ePCR-related knowledge: ePCR functionality, coding skills, and computational thinking skills, were integrated to teach students ePCR technology in middle-grade math lessons. Results showed three types of lesson plans, including lessons to use basic ePCR functionality to teach students lower-level CT skills, lessons to teach students basic to intermediate coding skills, and lessons to use the technology at the advanced level. Next, we applied the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and conducted a second two-step cluster analysis to identify how the technology (ePCR technology), content (math knowledge), and pedagogy (activity design) were integrated into those lesson plans. Results suggested ten clusters of lesson plans with distinct features. We summarized those ten lesson clusters into five categories: 1) ePCR technology lessons, 2) transdisciplinary problem-based learning lessons, 3) technology-assisted lessons, 4) lessons without real-world connections, and 5) lessons integrating middle-grade math learning into ePCR projects.

abstract = {Evaluating nascent educational interventions requires a specific kind of evaluation theory. This paper provides a case example of the emergent design evaluation approach, one theory created for use with developing interventions, but that has limited examples within published literature for practitioners to learn from. The emergent design evaluation theory was used to evaluate the design and implementation of a high school biology unit integrating computational thinking and neural engineering, including teacher professional development and a web-based application. A contribution of this paper, beyond the case example it provides, is that the emergent design evaluation was combined with design-based research, a complementary approach. Consistent with the practices uniquely characteristic of emergent design evaluation, this paper describes critical points or key occasions in which aspects of the intervention influence the evaluation process, or vice versa, including the nature and direction of influence. By demonstrating the process of combining emergent design evaluation and design-based research, this paper adds to discussions within the field about how to intentionally weave together different knowledge generation approaches that both meet evaluation demands and align with the evaluation context.}

Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis was used to determine the mediating relationship between 21st century skills. The study participants were 714 undergraduate students from various regions of Turkey selected through purposive sampling and who participated on a voluntary basis. Computational thinking, effective communication, and digital literacy scales were used and a significant correlation was found between all the 21st century skills. A series of structural equation models were tested. The final model suggests that, in line with predictions, critical thinking mediates the relationship between the 21st century skills of cooperativity, digital literacy, creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem solving. However, somewhat different from predictions is the finding that communication skills directly predict problem solving without further mediation. Thus, overall, the findings indicate that critical thinking has a crucial mediating role between other 21st century skills and problem solving.}

Students need to achieve a certain level of 3D fluency in modeling, animation, and programming to be able to create compelling 3D content. The combination of innovative end-user development tools and standards-based curriculum that promotes IT fluency by shifting the pedagogical focus from programming to design, can address motivational aspects without sacrificing principled educational goals. The AgentCubes 3D game-authoring environment raises the ceiling of end-user development without raising the threshold. Our formal user study shows that with Incremental 3D, the gradual approach to transition from 2D to 3D authoring, middle school students can build sophisticated 3D games including 3D models, animations, and programming.}

In detail: the educational levels and the school subjects in which storytelling and educational robotics are applied, the types of robots used, the duration, the sample size, participants' age and the skills that students may develop through this combination. Additionally, we analyzed, grouped, and presented the tools used for measuring the potential effects of storytelling and educational robotics. Finally, the students' role in the activities was sought. Based on our findings, most interventions mainly addressed preschool and primary school students, the robots used the most are humanoid, most interventions did not exceed 6 h, and the number of participants was less than 20 students. Besides, most interventions tried to develop students’ skills (communication, creativity, collaboration) and attitudes (engagement, motivation, participation) with qualitative tools borrowed from other domains (e.g. psychology, healthcare). This scoping demonstrates a gap in the use of storytelling and educational robotics in secondary and university education and subjects like history, geography, etc. Finally, this combination seems to have the potential to enhance the educational process, but more research is needed to shed light on all the aspects of the combination.}

For all students, there were significant increases in entity beliefs and significant decreases in incremental beliefs across the semester. However, examination of effect sizes suggests that significant findings for change across time were driven by changes in specific subpopulations of students. Moreover, results showed that students endorsed incremental belief more strongly than entity belief at both the beginning and end of the semester. Furthermore, the magnitude of changes differed based on students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profiles. Additionally, students’ achievement outcomes were weakly predicted by their implicit beliefs of intelligence. Finally, results showed that the relationship between changes in implicit intelligence beliefs and student achievement varied across different CS1 courses. Theoretical implications for implicit intelligence beliefs and recommendations for STEM educators are discussed.}

In this study, we present a supervised approach to training a deep neural network to analyze children's computational thinking (CT) captured through multimodal video data. The approach first uses a set of images extracted from video data to train the AI to map them to labels generated using a priori theory. Confusion matrices were used to establish the performance of the AI by comparing AI predictions to human analysis on a validation set of data. The findings suggested that the AI classified several aspects of children's CT in a way that was highly consistent with human analysis, demonstrating how the AI could serve as an additional team member during multimodal analysis.

abstract = {Education's evolution in the context of energy systems is essential for addressing sustainable energy challenges and developing a workforce equipped for future innovations, emphasizing both formal curricula and informal lifelong learning through successful energy case studies. As the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. Exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar-powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). Based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. The studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. The present work's main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. Energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two-objective optimization were extracted. Parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed system's performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. In addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. To find the best values of decision variables, multi-objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. The results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 $/h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 $/h). The outcomes of this work can play a critical role for higher education institutions in advancing innovative solutions to pressing energy challenges. Lifelong learning, at the heart of educational innovation, can benefit from the integration of sustainable energy systems as a core component of informal education through the optimization of ejector refrigeration systems.}

We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing. This qualitative study reveals the commonalities across existing kits and highlights ways for designers and researchers to expand the possibilities for children to create, explore, and play with computing.}

We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors. We discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners’ attitudes toward coding over time.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has led to a sudden change in education, closing schools and shifting to online teaching, which has become an enormous challenge for teachers and students. Implementing adequate online pedagogical approaches and integrating different digital tools in the teaching process have become a priority in educational systems. Finding a way to keep students' interest and persistence in learning is an important issue that online education is facing. One possible way to establish engaging and interactive learning environments, using the energy and enthusiasm of students for educational purposes, is the use of game-based learning activities and gamification of different parts of the educational process.
Objective
This paper presents a use case of migrating an escape room–style educational game to an online environment by using the design thinking methodology. We wanted to show that the design thinking methodology is useful to create engaging and motivating online games that provide educational value.
Methods
Starting from students’ perspective, we created a simple digital escape room–style game where students got an opportunity to self-assess their knowledge in computer science at their own pace. Students tested this prototype game, and their opinions about the game were collected through an online survey. The test's goal was to evaluate the students' perceptions about the implemented digital escape room–style educational game and gather information about whether it could achieve students' engagement in learning computer science during online teaching.
Results
In total, 117 students from sixth and seventh grades completed the survey regarding the achieved student engagement. Despite the differences in students’ answers about game complexity and puzzle difficulty, most students liked the activity (mean 4.75, SD 0.67, on a scale from 1 to 5). They enjoyed the game, and they would like to participate in this kind of activity again (mean 4.74, SD 0.68). All (n=117, 100%) students found the digital escape room–style educational game interesting for playing and learning.
Conclusions
The results confirmed that digital escape room–style games could be used as an educational tool to engage students in the learning process and achieve learning outcomes. Furthermore, the design thinking methodology proved to be a useful tool in the process of adding novel educational value to the digital escape room–style game.}

abstract = {In this commentary, we make a case for the explicit inclusion of combinatorial topics in mathematics curricula, where it is currently essentially absent. We suggest ways in which researchers might inform the field’s understanding of combinatorics and its potential role in curricula. We reflect on five decades of research that has been conducted since a call by Kapur (1970) for a greater focus on combinatorics in mathematics education. Specifically, we discuss the following five assertions: 1) Combinatorics is accessible, 2) Combinatorics problems provide opportunities for rich mathematical thinking, 3) Combinatorics fosters desirable mathematical practices, 4) Combinatorics can contribute positively to issues of equity in mathematics education, and 5) Combinatorics is a natural domain in which to examine and develop computational thinking and activity. Ultimately, we make a case for the valuable and unique ways in which combinatorics might effectively be leveraged within K-16 curricula.}

To formally explore this question, we conducted a naturalistic observation of a one-week program designed to teach foundational coding skills (i.e., sequencing, conditions, loops) to young children (N = 28, Mage = 5.15 years) using two tablet applications: Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children.}

A micro-analytic video study was conducted of primary school children designing their own technologies using existing educational microcontrollers. Our investigation reveals that the roles feedback plays in children’s interactions cannot easily be assimilated within the existing approaches to understand feedback that have been articulated in HCI literature. Our qualitative analysis shows how children do not make sense of feedback as semantic communication from the system, but make sense of it with respect to its embeddedness in a sequence of activities they are performing with the system and each other. The principal contribution to emerge from our study is a conception of feedback as a process, rather than as a semantic communicative event, nor a direct coupling of action and system response. Our discussion identifies how feedback participates in the institutional agendas of classrooms (e.g. discovery, computational thinking), and draws out initial implications for the design of feedback in educational tangible technologies, identifying possibilities for how feedback might be redesigned to better promote children’s diagnostic practices with open-ended technology kits.}

Sixteen students (9 female) studying university-level computing were asked to explain their understanding of computing concepts (without materials) in individually video-recorded sessions. We analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. In total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 × 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. Our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) Computing Constructs as Physical Objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) Computing Processes as Motion along a Path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences. We contrast our findings to similar research in mathematics and discuss implications for computing pedagogy – namely the role of gesture in the classroom and technologies that can exploit embodied metaphors.}

The answers confirm that this type of course becomes a new fascinating manner of spending spare time by children. Moreover, quantitative analysis of student’s finals projects also has been performed. In the process of creative programming in the game-based environment, children develop the computational thinking skills, problem-solving strategies, and abstract thinking. Moreover, children are supported by their parents, who notice how important these competences are and how great opportunities they will present for children in future. Authors continue to grow Scratch programming course to democratize access to new technologies and education, preparing future generation for a world in which computational and algorithmic thinking is a central part of problem-solving. Perhaps some of the course participants will continue their study of programming and make it a career for their life.}

keywords = {coding, medical education, undergraduate curriculum},
abstract = {Background
The ability to construct simple computer programs (coding) is being progressively recognized as a life skill. Coding is now being taught to primary-school children worldwide, but current medical students usually lack coding skills, and current measures of computer literacy for medical students focus on the use of software and internet safety. There is a need to train a cohort of doctors who can both practice medicine and engage in the development of useful, innovative technologies to increase efficiency and adapt to the modern medical world.
Objective
The aim of the study was to address the following questions: (1) is it possible to teach undergraduate medical students the basics of computer coding in a 2-day course? (2) how do students perceive the value of learning computer coding at medical school? and (3) do students see computer coding as an important skill for future doctors?
Methods
We developed a short coding course to teach self-selected cohorts of medical students basic coding. The course included a 2-day introduction on writing software, discussion of computational thinking, and how to discuss projects with mainstream computer scientists, and it was followed on by a 3-week period of self-study during which students completed a project. We explored in focus groups (FGs) whether students thought that coding has a place in the undergraduate medical curriculum.
Results
Our results demonstrate that medical students who were complete novices at coding could be taught enough to be able to create simple, usable clinical programs with 2 days of intensive teaching. In addition, 6 major themes emerged from the FGs: (1) making sense of coding, (2) developing the students’ skill set, (3) the value of coding in medicine, research, and business, (4) role of teaching coding in medical schools, (5) the concept of an enjoyable challenge, and (6) comments on the course design.
Conclusions
Medical students can acquire usable coding skills in a weekend course. They valued the teaching and identified that, as well as gaining coding skills, they had acquired an understanding of its potential both for their own projects and in health care delivery and research. They considered that coding skills teaching should be offered as an optional part of the medical curriculum.}

However, the integration of these fundamental skills into formal and official curriculums is still a challenge and educators needs pedagogical perspectives to properly integrate robotics, coding and computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. Thus, this study evaluates a “coding as a playground” experience in keeping with the Positive Technological Development (PTD) framework with the KIBO robotics kit, specially designed for young children. The research was conducted with preschool children aged 3–5 years old (N = 172) from three Spanish early childhood centers with different socio-economic characteristics and teachers of 16 classes. Results confirm that it is possible to start teaching this new literacy very early (at 3 years old). Furthermore, the results show that the strategies used promoted communication, collaboration and creativity in the classroom settings. The teachers also exhibited autonomy and confidence to integrate coding and computational thinking into their formal curricular activities, connecting concepts with art, music and social studies. Through the evidence found in this study, this research contributes with examples of effective strategies to introduce robotics, coding and computational thinking into early childhood classrooms.}

We designed VotestratesML, following a Constructive Design Research approach, as an ethics-first learning tool that allow students to explore implications of ML for democratic elections. Based on deployments of VotestratesML in two high school social studies classrooms, we found that safely exploring ML from a concrete starting point helped students reflect and form opinions about its use, that promoting iterative exploration through collaboration and competition motivated them to explore, and that foregrounding ethics in the design and grounding ML in a well-known subject area allowed them to engage with ML on a personal level.}

abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing emphasis placed on access to computational thinking (CT) instruction for every K-12 student in the United States (U.S.). Concurrently, calls for integrating CT concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts have also increased. This is reflected by the inclusion of CT in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy. However, methods for teaching CT concepts within secondary level STEM courses vary drastically. Physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the U.S. in attempts to integrate CT within authentic STEM problem-solving contexts. Despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. A mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students’ attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. The results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and career/future use of computing concepts. Students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. Furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices. This study provides implications for improving physical computing instruction and integration within STEM education contexts.}

We present four key findings based on school visits, interviews, an electronical survey, two questionnaires, and workshops including theme discussions: (1) teachers did not perceive Technology Comprehension as a distinct subject, but rather as a set of skills that can be integrated into other subjects; (2) teachers pointed out that Technology Comprehension opens up for interdisciplinary and engaging learning activities, but they need more scaffolding and support; (3) Technology Comprehension challenges teachers’ existing competencies and there is a need for a framework that takes into account computing, design, and societal reflection as a whole; (4) Technology Comprehension appealed to various kind of students, not only those who are enthusiastic about technical matters. This study contributes to the previous research on making and digital fabrication by addressing how these endeavours are implemented on a national level through engaging with local teachers. We call for more research on scaffolding and supporting teachers to orchestrate meaningful learning activities to successfully integrate Technology Comprehension into the Danish national education.}

While several researchers have explored the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in serious games, many of these games have not been critically explained or evaluated. To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players’ qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. We provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work.}

This article presents a pedagogical framework for supporting middle schoolers to become co-designers and makers of their own machine learning applications. It presents a case study conducted in the 6th grade of a Finnish elementary school and analyzes students’ (N=34) evolving ML ideas and explanations. Data consists of a children’s artwork, students’ design ideas and co-designed applications, and structured group interviews organized at the end of the ML project. The qualitative content analysis revealed how hands-on exploration with ML-based technologies supported students in developing various kinds of design ideas that harnessed face recognition, gestures, or voice recognition for solving real-life problems. The results of the study further indicated that co-designing ML applications provided a promising entry point for students to develop their conceptual understanding of ML principles, its workflows, and its role in their everyday practices. The article concludes with a discussion on how to support students to become innovators and software designers in the age of machine learning.}
